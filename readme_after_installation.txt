Thank you for installing Debatify!

You can now launch the app from the Start Menu or the desktop shortcut (if selected).

Tips:
- Use the Theme toggle to switch between light and dark mode.
- All data is saved locally, including your notes and scoring history.
- You can reset or clear the app's data from the settings screen (coming soon!).

We hope Debatify helps you run smoother and more efficient debates.
Enjoy!
